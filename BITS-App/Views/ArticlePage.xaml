The situation spiraled out of control from then on. In February of 2022, the Abbott Nutrition facility in Sturgis, Michigan was shut down and certain formulas were recalled due to a bacterial infection in their formulas that caused four hospitalizations, two of which ended in death. Considering that Abbott is one of the four major baby formula manufacturers, and making up 40% of the baby formula market, the plant shut-down has shown its drastic effects nationwide. "

Additionally, while many may think the solution is to simply breastfeed their child, the reality is not always that easy. Certain mothers can not breastfeed their childâ€”perhaps they are unable to produce healthy breast milk, or maybe they're undergoing medication that does not support breastfeeding. Some mothers may simply choose not to breastfeed. "

In May of 2022, the FDA eased regulations on imports into the states in order to bring in foreign baby formulas, and President Joe Biden aided in the process by using the Defense Production Act which sped up authorization. The imports seem to have worked as, according to the New York Post, out-of-stock rates for all types of baby formulas were 30% the week ending July 24th, compared to 32% the week prior. However, despite this progress, the baby formula shortage is still far from over."
